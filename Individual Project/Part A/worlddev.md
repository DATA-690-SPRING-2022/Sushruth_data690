## Abstract 

Climate change risks are developing at such a rapid rate that they may soon outstrip both nature's and humans' ability to adapt unless greenhouse gas emissions are drastically reduced.
Many parts of the world may soon reach their limitations in terms of how much they can adapt to a changing climate if temperatures continue to rise. Since the 19th century, people have pumped heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere by burning coal, oil, and gas for energy and chopping down forests, causing global temperatures to rise by an average of 1.1 degrees Celsius, or 2 degrees Fahrenheit. 
 Natural ecosystems vary greatly in how much and for how long carbon is retained, depending on the interplay between climate, soils, plants, and previous disturbance in a given location. As a result, initiatives to maintain the integrity of forest ecosystems or expand their area will have a favorable impact on greenhouse gas mitigation in general. Despite scientists' warnings that drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are required now, none of the world's largest economies, including the whole G20, have a climate strategy that meets their commitments under the  Paris Agreement.
 In this Paper I will highlights How these countries have been doing with respect to expansion of Agricultural cover, Forest cover and Greenhouse gas emission, which one of main parameters to detect if the countries are moving in right direction to be sustainable.

## Reason for my reasearch
My anxities towards earths health since I was a Kid . I am member of UMBC environmental club, every week we scout the exteriors of campus for non-bio degreables and collect as part of cleanup . 
Having known that every year, the earth's health is deteriotating and the countries are not taking any drastic steps to improve sustainablity 

## Reasearch Questions that will be answered. 
- Have countires  improved forest cover or not? Which countries are lagging ? 
- Which countries have expanded their land into agricultural cover ?
- Which countries have been emitting greenhouse gases above threshold?
- In due to above consequences, have affected in endagerment of species . 


* ### A. Forest Cover analysis with respect to G20 countires. * 

In order to curb the green house emissions, It is essential that the countries increase Forest cover.

Since this is draft, I will be working on the below pointers in my final version 

1. Give more obervations to the Images and name the images and videos.

2. Make my dociment like a story flow.

3. I will add section of - Strategy and Approach and conclusitions
