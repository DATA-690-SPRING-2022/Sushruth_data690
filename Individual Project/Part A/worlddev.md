## Abstract 

Climate change risks are developing at such a rapid rate that they may soon outstrip both nature's and humans' ability to adapt unless greenhouse gas emissions are drastically reduced.
Many parts of the world may soon reach their limitations in terms of how much they can adapt to a changing climate if temperatures continue to rise. Since the 19th century, people have pumped heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere by burning coal, oil, and gas for energy and chopping down forests, causing global temperatures to rise by an average of 1.1 degrees Celsius, or 2 degrees Fahrenheit. 
 Natural ecosystems vary greatly in how much and for how long carbon is retained, depending on the interplay between climate, soils, plants, and previous disturbance in a given location. As a result, initiatives to maintain the integrity of forest ecosystems or expand their area will have a favorable impact on greenhouse gas mitigation in general. Despite scientists' warnings that drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are required now, none of the world's largest economies, including the whole G20, have a climate strategy that meets their commitments under the  Paris Agreement.
 In this Paper I will highlights How these countries have been doing with respect to expansion of Agricultural cover, Forest cover and Greenhouse gas emission, which one of main parameters to detect if the countries are moving in right direction to be sustainable.

## Reason for my reasearch
My anxities towards earths health since I was a Kid . I am member of UMBC environmental club, every week we scout the exteriors of campus for non-bio degreables and collect as part of cleanup . 
Having known that every year, the earth's health is deteriotating and the countries are not taking any drastic steps to improve sustainablity 

## Reasearch Questions that will be answered. 
- Have countires  improved forest cover or not? Which countries are lagging ? 
- Which countries have expanded their land into agricultural cover ?
- Which countries have been emitting greenhouse gases above threshold?
- In due to above consequences, have affected in endagerment of species . 


* ### A. Forest Cover analysis with respect to G20 countires. * 

In order to curb the green house emissions, It is essential that the countries increase Forest cover.

Observation 1  - 
  - Currently, Japan , korea and brazil has the highest forest cover % 
  - United Kingdom,Argentina and Saudi has the least, because of their small landcover and high population density.

Below is the figure 2, a  wordmap view of the forest cover, Right range color has the most forest cover as oposed to green gradient ones.

Figure 3, below shows forest cover  where g20 countries are grouped in terms of contients 
 - East Asia and Pacific has the highest and exceeding marginally compared to Europe and Central Asia.
 - North America, SOuth Asia has comparitively less, because few countries represent from those respective contitnents.

Figure 4 below, shows the timeline of forest cover change across G20 countries .
- It is observed that Indonesia has shown downward trend in forest cover, there from 52% to 48% , that is , there has been loss of 4%  between the years 2015 to 2020 respectively. This is something that the UN organisation should look up and warn them to contribute for earth health.
- Brazil forest cover has steadily reduced from 63% to 59% over the couple decades 2005 to 2020 . Similar case with argentina where 
- On the other Hand, China forest cover has increased from 21% to 25% during year 2010 to 2020.

* Change in forest cover over the years *

Observation on Video 1 above, which shows the change in forest cover over the years in a animated format, extracted from the website. 
- The Indonesia slipped a position low over the years and is behind Russia. 
- Forest cover of Brazil has decreased tremendosly, which is a negative sign in perspective of earths climate change, Speciaies endagerment and green house gas problem.
- China, Italy, France, India are few of the countries that have actually increased their forest cover in their land, which is good sign. 



* ### B. Agriculture Cover analysis with respect to G20 countires. * 

Agricultural deforestation accounts for roughly 80% of tropical deforestation, while logging is the leading cause of forest degradation. Though an exact figure for how many trees are cut down each year is difficult to come by, the estimate is between 3.5 and 7 billion. Agricultural expansion, which includes growing crops for livestock and clearing land for grazing, accounts for nearly 30% of this estimate. Hence , it is essential for mankind to make sure we adopt new methods of sustainable agriculture to avoid this crisis.

The above Figure, shows the line of G20 as per to know agricultural land area. 
Observation - 
- South Africa, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom and India are among the top G20 countires to have highest agricultural land.
- Canada, Russia and Japan have the lost % of agricultural land compared to other G20 countires.

* ### C. Green House gas emission by G20 countries. *

Since this is draft, I will be working on the below pointers in my final version 

1. Give more obervations to the Images and name the images and videos.

2. Make my dociment like a story flow.

3. I will add section of - Strategy and Approach and conclusitions
